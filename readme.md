## Code

### Abstract

An R package (called aceodes) and a vignette have been included as Supplementary Material.

### Description

The R package aceodes contains code to reproduce all of the designs found in the paper. The vignette describes how the designs can be reproduced, and also reproduces Figures 2 to 7 in the paper.

### Optional Information

To use aceodes, the user will need R (at least version 3.5.0) and the R package acebayes (at least version 1.6.0). The latter is freely available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/
packages/acebayes/index.html).


## Instructions for use

### Reproducibility

The vignette (included as Supplementary Material and authored using knitr) provides in depth instructions on how to use the R package aceodes (in conjunction with acebayes) to reproduce the designs found in the paper. In addition, the vignette provides code for reproducing Figures 2 to 7 of the paper.
